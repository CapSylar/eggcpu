# eggcpu

I don't know why egg is in the name, but eggcpu will be a small riscV core in verilog. Will definetly suck but will probably serve as a very good workbench to try out some stuff.

## Single-Cycle-RiscV-Subset

First iteration of the design, a single cycle core that supports only a tiny subset of the `riscV32I` instruction set:

-   add
-   sub
-   lw
-   sw
-   bne
-   beq
-   and
-   or

## Pipelined-RiscV-Subset

Second iteration of the design, will hopefully support all of the instructions, and have a 5-stage pipeline with the following stages:
`Instruction Read` => `Instruction Decode` => `Execute` => `Mem R/W` => `Write Back`

-   `TODO`


## Simulation

For now I'm using `Verilator` to convert Verilog to C++ and then running that. So as to not worry about manually decoding the instruction to test the cores I wrote a small C++ program to read the `.text` section from the `elf` file generated by `riscv32-elf-as` and then reading in the generated memory file using `$readmemh` in verilog.
